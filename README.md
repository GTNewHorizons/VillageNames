This is a mod for Minecraft Forge that allows the user to generate random names for Villagers and villages.

The config files allow you to generate names for nearly any vanilla or mod entity so long as you know the class path.

Right-clicking blank books on villagers records the village's information, and if the villager has many unlocked trades and/or your village reputation is high, villagers may record a hint about directions to a feature such as e.g. a Stronghold or Temple.

Right-clicking emeralds and/or iron/gold ingots onto a Librarian causes them to generate a Codex, with which you can record names for unpopulated structures (e.g. Temples, Mineshafts).

There are config options allowing you to generate names for modded structures, either with a Codex or by clicking a book onto an entity of your choice, provided that the structure data is stored in a particular format.

Additionally, villagers have adopted the modular JE 1.14 skins and offer trades similar to JE 1.14 and BE 1.12.
These modular skins include:

*  Outer garb and accessories based on the villager's profession/career, with
   native support for some mod professions, and a system to implement custom
   profession outfits
*  Underclothes based on spawning biome, with many custom additions for various
   generic biome types (e.g. Forest, Highlands)
*  Villager skin tones, where the skin color of ensemble populations vary based
   on properties of their spawning biome

This mod is not compatible with Villager Mantle Fix, because Village Names villagers have headwear. However, v3.2
includes an on/off value for all mod villager headwear, and a headwear "graylist" which allows the player to
specify professions to enable/disable headwear irrespective of the on/off value.

Mod versions 1.7.10 through 1.11.2 have backported Concrete, Concrete Powder, and Glazed Terracotta.

Mod versions 1.7.10 and 1.8.9 have Igloos.

Version 1.7.10 has backported Prismarine, absorbent Sponges, Ocean Monuments, and Guardians.
